Given the safety risks associated with urban environments, such as tall buildings and other obstacles, the spaces available for vertiports are highly constrained. To address these challenges, vertiport layouts must be optimized to ensure efficient resource utilization and maximize operational capacity. This article introduces a multi-floor vertiport layout problem that determines optimal designs by considering both spatial availability and operational constraints. Unlike previous studies, which often determined vertiport layouts heuristically based on representative topologies, the proposed approach guarantees the optimality of the resulting layout design and is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of constraints. Two illustrative examples of optimal vertiport layouts—single-level and multi-level—are presented, demonstrating practical applications of the proposed optimization problem. The findings of this study provide valuable insights to support decision-making for vertiport planners, constructors and operators.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">park2026optimal</span><span class="p">,</span>

Due to the inherently stochastic nature of on-demand requests, maintaining high service availability—particularly vehicle availability at vertiports—poses a significant challenge in planning on-demand UAM services. In this study, we develop a closed Jackson network model with passenger loss to model the dynamics of on-demand UAM systems. We formulate a profit-maximization problem to optimize fleet size while ensuring minimum service availability. The proposed mathematical formulation explicitly incorporates demand uncertainty and evaluates the trade-off between proactive fleet provisioning and reactive passenger compensation strategies. We present an iterative exact search solution method to compute optimal fleet size and demonstrate its effectiveness in a Seoul City case study, where a fleet of 40 vehicles maximizes profit in the baseline. We further show that incorporating reactive passenger compensation strategies increases optimal fleet sizes (to 48 and 55 vehicles for moderate and high compensation levels, respectively) to maintain the target service availability, at the cost of significantly reduced profitability. These findings provide quantitative insights for UAM fleet operators and policymakers planning on-demand mobility services.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">park2025uam</span><span class="p">,</span>

UAM operations start and end at a vertiport, the airport for UAM. Therefore, optimal vertiport locations are essential for efficient and effective UAM operation. This study proposes a vertiport location problem to determine optimal vertiport locations under the decision-dependent and probabilistic demands of UAM. The proposed location problem is a quadratic programming problem that maximizes the total UAM demand determined by travel time and cost. This study introduces a heuristic algorithm to efficiently solve real-world problems in a large, congested metropolitan area. Results of the case study showed that the vertiport network can be expanded in stages: the optimal locations in a smaller network (e.g., five vertiports) are all included in a larger network (e.g., ten vertiports). However, planning is necessary before action, as transport facilities such as vertiports are costly and difficult to relocate. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of various operational aspects of UAM, such as the catchment area and minimum flight distance, on the optimal vertiport locations. As a result, vertiport accessibility is critical to the profitability of UAM. Decision-makers can use the results of this study to plan a vertiport network for air taxi services in metropolitan areas.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">kim2025optimal</span><span class="p">,</span>

VOT continues to change as travel characteristics and travel behavior change. In addition, the VOT of the transportation modes used by traveler can vary greatly depending on the travel time value of the traveler, the purpose of the trip, the number of repeat passengers, etc. VOT is used as important basic data for determining transportation policies, such as analyzing the effects of transportation SOC projects and introduction of transportation modes, analyzing the travel behavior of passengers, and fare levels for transportation facilities &amp; modes. In particular, VOT can be said to be an essential element in calculating travel time reduction benefits from transportation facility investment projects such as roads, railroads, and airports, and has the most decisive influence in determining the economic feasibility of transportation facility investment projects. However, The VOT in the metropolitan area of most existing studies was analyzed based on travel between regions across the nationwide, so there are bound to be limitations in reflecting the travel characteristics of the metropolitan area. Compared to regions across the nationwide, the metropolitan area has a high level of traffic congestion, a high level of public transportation supply and service, and therefore a high public transportation usage rate. In addition, the travel characteristics, such as the purpose of travel, are different, and the characteristics of the travelers, such as income and economic activities, are different. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to calculate reasonable VOT for representative transportation modes such as auto, buses, subways, and trucks in the metropolitan area, focusing on Gyeonggi-do. For this purpose, unlike previous studies, VOT that could better reflect the reality of the metropolitan area were calculated based on metropolitan area statistical data and travel survey data. First, the VOT of traveler in the metropolitan area was calculated according to the transportation modes and trip purpose. The VOT of drivers by transportation mode was calculated by applying the wage rate method, and the VOT of traveler by transportation mode was calculated by applying the marginal substitution rate. The VOT for work and non-work, leisure, general trip purposes on personal transportation in the metropolitan area are calculated as 31,064 won/hour･person, 25,631 won/hour･person, 24,127 won/hour･person, 26,758 won/hour･person. In addition, the VOT for work and non-work, leisure, general trip purpose on public transportation in the metropolitan area is calculated as 26,850 won/hour･person, 20,966 won/hour･person, 19,814 won/hour･person, 21,937 won/hour･person. Next, by applying the existing guidelines and methods of related research, the VOT based on transportation mode was calculated considering business and non-business trip. The VOT of transportation modes in the metropolitan area was calculated as 32,725 won/hour･vehicle, 356,254 won/hour･vehicle, 24,932 won/hour･vehicle, and 21,083 won/hour･person for auto, bus, truck, and subway. The VOT of this study was calculated to be relatively high compared to the results of previous studies, and the VOT of other trip purposes was also calculated to be relatively high compared to work trip. These results are believed to reflect the characteristics of travel in the metropolitan area more realistically because this study used travel data of a large number of metropolitan area traveler. It is expected that the results of this study can be used as standards and basic data that can be more reasonably applied to the metropolitan area in the future. In addition, this study used traffic survey data from 2021, the period affected by COVID-19. Accordingly, it is believed that VOT may have been calculated high because the trips are mainly important to travelers. Therefore, the results of this study need to be verified through future supplementary surveys and continuous research, and there is a need to review changes.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@techreport</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Kim2023Value</span><span class="p">,</span>

A series of analytical processes for vertiport design, demand prediction, and performance analysis is presented. To design the vertiport layout, we propose a novel algorithm that evaluates the surrounding obstacles by considering current regulations. The potential demand for air taxi services by urban air mobility (UAM) as multimodal transportation is predicted by a discrete choice model that estimates the probability of choosing an air taxi service given the time saving of UAM. Then, the sensitivity of demand was analyzed for the catchment area, travel cost, and the number of passengers on board. The sensitivity analysis showed that the demand for UAM was sensitive to all factors considered. Vertiport performance is evaluated by comparing the expected number of operations derived from the UAM demand to the vertiport capacity. The proposed methodology was applied to a vertiport in the Seoul metropolitan area for the initial UAM operations. The results show that having one less gate significantly increases the waiting time of the UAM when the utilization factor of the waiting queue is high. However, the average waiting time is less than 20 min (the maximum hover time of eVTOL vehicles) if the vertiport has a sufficient number of gates, depending on the traffic volume of UAM. Therefore, it is essential to determine the number of gates considering the expected traffic volume to ensure safe UAM operations.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">park2022vertiport_performance</span><span class="p">,</span>

A numerical experiment for the Samseong vertiport in Seoul, Korea is presented, and the impacts of two objective functions on the vertiport design are analyzed.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">park2022vertiport_design</span><span class="p">,</span>
